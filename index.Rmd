***Here, I try to keep track of my sequencing data analysis practice***

## Notes

-   I am a recent master's graduate (and soon-to-be PhD student) in life science. I have an interest in skeletal muscle biology and epigenetics. This is why the data I choose revolve mainly around these two themes.

-   I've been trained mostly at the bench and am not very good at computer in general. Therefore, most of the codes are generated thanks to Google and ChatGPT. I'm sorry if they don't look neat and tidy enough. I will try to cite every source that I learn from, but sometimes it is a bit of reference here and there and some of them might be missed :((

-   As we mention ChatGPT, this HTML-website was built, and is being constantly refined, over hours of chatting with the AI.
